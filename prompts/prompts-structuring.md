I want to create an ebook titled "Quick Guide: 10 Key Digital Security Practices for Everyday Life"

with security and defense practices and mindset.

The ebook should be structured as follows:

General introduction,
table of contents,
headings.

Rules:
Each heading must contain 900 words including introduction, practices, case study, and conclusion. All with truthful information, without fantasy or illusion.
